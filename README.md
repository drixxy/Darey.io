# Darey.io DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my DevOps learning portfolio! This repository, "Darey.io," documents my journey as I learn DevOps engineering on the Darey.io learning management platform.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a central hub for all the mini-projects and capstone projects I complete during my DevOps training. It's designed to:

* **Showcase my skills:** Demonstrate my practical abilities in various DevOps tools and concepts.
* **Document my progress:** Track my learning journey and the evolution of my DevOps expertise.
* **Provide a portfolio:** Offer a tangible representation of my work for potential employers or collaborators.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by project. Each project has its own directory containing all relevant files and a detailed `README.md` file.
